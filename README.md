# Computational-Intelligence

This is the assignment works from course CSE2530 Computational Intelligence in TU Delft. This repository covers three relatively separate works:
[] A fully implemented MLP built from numpy with cross validation
[] A traveling salesman problem (TSP) solution using Generic algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization
[] A path finding application using Q-Learning
The work has been done by Tianchen Qu, Viet Luong, Nguyen Khoa and Hoang Minh.
