# Computational-Intelligence

This is the assignment works from course CSE2530 Computational Intelligence in TU Delft. This repository covers three relatively separate works:

- A fully implemented MLP built from numpy with cross validation
- A traveling salesman problem (TSP) solution using Generic algorithm for optimizing traveling sequence and Ant Colony Optimization for path finding
- A path finding application using Q-Learning

The work has been done by Tianchen Qu, Viet Luong, Nguyen Khoa and Hoang Minh.
